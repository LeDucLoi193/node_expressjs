This project is followed with my lesson at CodersX about nodejs and its framework - Expressjs.
# Getting started

You need some thing to install: 
- nodejs

# Installing
- You can use: 'npm install' to install all of my node package in my package.json.
- Then you can start the server with command: 'npm start' to run nodemon and go to browser and go to 'localhost:9999' or 'localhost:9998'
# Running the tests
These tests are created to test my knowledge about the lession. I make the test-todolist, it's simple to add but cannot delete becauseof the lowdb's method isn't working.
